# Introduction to quantum algorithms

This is the material for the hand-on sessions I delivered. Most of the content is taken from https://learning.quantum-computing.ibm.com/ with some modification. Check out the function to generate arbitrary oracles for the Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm.

The first notebook start from the basics, how to use qiskit, the Statevector class and some methods to run a quantum circuit. After that, phase kickback is introduced and applied to introduce Deutsch algorithm, Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm and Grover's algorithm.

The second notebook is an introduction to the Quantum Fourier Transform and Quantum Phase Estimation. As the last step, is described in detail the Order Finding Problem and Shor's Algorithm.
